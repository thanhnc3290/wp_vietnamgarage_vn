<h3>13. Live Update</h3>
(!! Temporarily disabled !!)
This WP AMP plugin uses the AMP Live List feature and checks every 16 seconds to see if a newer version exists on the server of the AMP site (for example, the Google Search server). If so, the user will be shown a hint button directly when reading the AMP page, informing the user that an update of the page is currently available. In this way, the user is actively informed of innovations, WITHOUT the user having to reload the AMP page! Thus, e.g. Live tickers or live blogs.

<h3>14. IVW Counter for the reach of your site / IVW SZM-Tag</h3>
If present, the Accelerated-Mobile-Pages (AMP) plugin recognizes the IVW offer identifier and IVW code from the IVW SZM tag of the website and adds these IVW settings to the AMP page! This will also add the IVW range of the AMP pages to their own online reach. In order for the IVW measurement to work correctly, the line "* .amp-cloud.de" (without quotation marks) must be added to the own locallist in the INFOnline account.

<h3>15. AMP Menu</h3>
If your Website uses the nav-Tag to render the navigation-bar the AMP Plugin will also generate a navigationbar for your AMP-Version, based on your nav-Tag-Section. 

<h3>Is your website indexed at the Google-AMP-Cache?</h3>
The faster pageload of AMP is generated by saving the AMP-Site onto the Google-Servers, which Google will do at itself. How much time this will take is different by each website and is based on the Google-Algorithms. To check, if is your site actually in the Google-AMP-Cache, you can test it with the following free online-tool:

This has the particular advantage that the AMP plugin can also automatically provide all AMP pages under an HTTPS connection, even if the plugin user himself does not have an SSL certificate for his website. According to Google's latest AMP recommendations, from a usability point of view, AMP pages should be better served under the actual domain's own domain so that users are not irritated by a foreign domain. With the new version "easy AMP Version 1.4" the AMP plugin is now optimized and provides the AMP pages directly under the own domain for a better user experience. If you want to continue to provide your AMP pages automatically under HTTPS, you must now enable HTTPS for your website! The AMP plugin "easy AMP" will continue to support it automatically! 

= Version 1.3 =
*13.11.2016 - AMP Feature: Added IVW tag detection. The AMP plugin takes over the IVW online count from the SZM tag of the website. For a correct IVW count, the line "* .amp-cloud.de" (without quotation marks) must be added to the IVW locale list.

= Version 1.1 =

Example-2:	www.MyWordPress.com/MyPath/MyPage.php?MyParameter=xyz&amp=1
(&amp=1 - If a query string is used)

= Version 1.0 =
*25.06.2016 - Until now, only the AMPHTML-Generator existed via amp-cloud.de and had to be installed manually via tag in each subpage. With the first version of "easy AMP" Creating AMP versions in a WordPress blog is much easier. The WordPress pages no longer need to be customized individually. - Just install the AMP plugin, activate it and you're done!



== Upgrade Notice ==
Versions before 4.0:
Every page will be cached for 24 hours. After 24 hours your AMP-Version gets an update.

Versions before 2.0:
For faster pageload after first creation of the AMP page the AMPHTML will now be cached on your server.
Every page will be cached for 1 hour. After 1 hour your AMP-Version get an update.

Versions before 1.9:
For a better website performance, the request URL for the AMP generator was changed back to the domain www.amp-cloud.de.
An update to the AMP plugin version 1.9 is strongly recommended to improve the load times of the AMP site!

Versions before 1.8:
Uses a wrong domain to create the AMP pages, instead of faster.amp-cloud.de fast.amp-cloud.de was used, which leads to an error. With version 1.8 this circumstance was solved.
An update to the AMP plugin version 1.8 is strongly recommended!

Versions before 1.7:
The WP AMP plugin now needs to create the AMP pages via the subdomain fater.amp-cloud.de, making the AMP plugin WP easy AMP have to create the AMPHTML tag differently in the source code.
The AMP plugin update to version 1.7 is responsible for this change. Currently the AMP plugin version 1.6 will continue to work, but the 1.7 version reduces the DNS lookups, because the new subdomain is used directly!

Versions before 1.6:
Due to features in the previous AMP plugin versions, a reference to amp-cloud.de was necessary in the privacy policy. Since the AMP plugin version 1.5.1, however, this reference must refer to the own domain.
The AMP plugin version 1.6 now adds your own domain for the privacy notices.

Versions before 1.5.1:
In previous AMP plug-in versions, the cURL calls may not work correctly, and will only produce a blank, white page.
As of AMP-Plugin 1.5.1 this circumstance is avoided!

Versions before 1.5:
Do not create AMP versions in certain situations.
